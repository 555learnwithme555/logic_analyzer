SUMP compatible logic analyzer for Arduino
==========================================

This Arduino sketch implements a SUMP protocol compatible with the standard
SUMP client as well as the alternative client from here:
	http://www.lxtreme.nl/ols/

This SUMP protocol compatible logic analyzer for the Arduino board supports
5 channels consisting of digital pins 8-12, which are the first 5 bits (0-4)
of PORTB. Arduino pin 13 / bit 5 is the Arduino LED, bits 6 & 7 are the
crystal oscillator pins.
Uncomment CHAN5 below if you want to use the LED pin as an input and have
6 channels.

NOTE:
You must DISABLE the Arduino auto reset feature to use this logic analyzer
code. There are various methods to do this, some boards have a jumper,
others require you to cut a trace.  You may also install a *precisely*
120 Ohm resistor between the reset & 5V piins.  Make sure it is really
120 Ohm or you may damage your board.

To use this with the original or alternative SUMP clients,
use these settings:

Sampling rate: 1MHz (or lower)
Channel Groups: 0 (zero) only
Recording Size: 512 (or lower)
Noise Filter: doesn't matter
RLE: disabled (unchecked)

Triggering is still a work in progress, but generally works for samples
below 1MHz.  1MHz works for a basic busy wait trigger that doesn't store
until after the trigger fires.
Please try it out and report back.

Release: v0.02 February 28, 2011.
